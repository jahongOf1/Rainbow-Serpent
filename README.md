# Rainbow-Serpent
My first video game. Submission for Itch.io Python Jam.

# Current Features

1. Orb changes color when pressing
z = red
x = blue
c = green

2. 2d movement - up, down, left, right.

# Bugs and Things That Need Fixing
1. Also the snake like effect was cool without a background, so
kept the bug (I think) as a feature.

2. Lack of ground or walls, and gravity is persistent but weak.

3. No Menus
